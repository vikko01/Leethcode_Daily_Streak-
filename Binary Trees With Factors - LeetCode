To solve this problem in Java, you can use dynamic programming.
It uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of valid binary trees that can be formed with the given integers, taking into account the modulo 10^9 + 7 constraint.

class Solution {
      private static final int MOD = 1000000007;
    public int numFactoredBinaryTrees(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int n = arr.length;
        long[] dp = new long[n];
        Arrays.fill(dp, 1);
        Map<Integer, Integer> index = new HashMap<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            index.put(arr[i], i);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (arr[i] % arr[j] == 0) {
                    int complement = arr[i] / arr[j];
                    if (index.containsKey(complement)) {
                        dp[i] += dp[j] * dp[index.get(complement)];
                        dp[i] %= MOD;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        long result = 0;
        for (long count : dp) {
            result += count;
        }

        return (int) (result % MOD);
    }
}

Time complexity: The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) because we have two nested loops, and n is the length of the input array arr. The map lookup and array operations are generally considered to be O(1) in complexity.

Space complexity: The space complexity is O(n) due to the array dp and the index map.
